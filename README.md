## Reporting Security Issues

The maintainer takes security seriously. If you discover a security issue,
please bring it to my attention right away!

Please **DO NOT** file a public issue, instead send your report privately to
[jishin85@gmail.com](mailto:jishin85@gmail.com).

Security reports are greatly appreciated and I will publicly thank you for it.
I also like to send gifts â€” if you're into schwag, make sure to let
me know. I currently do not offer a paid security bounty program, nor does CyberArk Software.
